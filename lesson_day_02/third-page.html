        <h1><p>Welcome to My Exercise Plan!</p></h1>
            <h3><p>Are you ready to get started on your fitness journey?</p></h3>
            <h4>
                <p>This simple exercise plan will help you build a foundation
            for a healthier and more active lifestyle.</p>
            </h4>
            <h4><p>Day 1: Walking</p></h4>
            Start with a 15-minute brisk walk around your neighborhood
            or a nearby park. Focus on maintaining good posture and breathing rhythmically.</p>
            
            <h4><p>Day 2: Stretching</p></h4>
            Perform a 10-minute stretching routine to improve flexibility.
            Include stretches for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and back.</p>
            <h4><p>Day 3: Squats</p></h4>
            Do 3 sets of 10 squats. Squats are great for building lower body strength.
            Keep your back straight, and go as low as you comfortably can.</p>
            <h4><p>Day 4: Rest</p></h4>
            Rest is essential for muscle recovery. Take a break today and focus on staying hydrated.</p>
            <h4><p>Day 5: Push-ups</p></h4>
            Perform 3 sets of 5 push-ups. If regular push-ups are too challenging,
            start with knee push-ups and work your way up.</p>
            <h4><p>Day 6: Jumping Jacks</p></h4>
            Do 3 sets of 15 jumping jacks. This is a great way to improve cardiovascular
            fitness and burn calories.</p>
            <h4><p>Day 7: Rest</p></h4>
            Another day of rest to allow your body to recover. Focus on healthy eating
            and staying active by walking or stretching.</p>
            <h3><p>Remember:</p>
            </h3>
            <p>Stay hydrated throughout your workouts.</p>
            <p>Listen to your body; don't push too hard, especially if you're just starting out.</p>
            <p>Consistency is key. Try to stick to your exercise plan and
gradually increase intensity as you become more comfortable.</p>
<p>Consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any
new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.</p>
